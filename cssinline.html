	Flipkart realizes the importance of a strong fraud 
	detection and resolution capability. We and our online payments partners
	 monitor transactions continuously for suspicious activity and flag potentially 
	 fraudulent transactions for manual verification by our team.
	In the rarest of rare cases, when our team is unable to 
	rule out the possibility offraud categorically, 
	the transaction is kept on hold, and the customer is requested to provide identity documents.
	 The ID documents help us ensure that the purchases were indeed made by a genuine card holder.
	 We apologise for any inconvenience that may be caused to customers and request them to
	 bear with us in the larger interest of ensuring a safe and secure environment
	 for online transactions.
